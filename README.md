# MolnMyra
an Node.JS ODM for Cloudant

This is my go at creating a more high-level abstraction built on top of the Cloudant Node.JS Client,
not necessarily an ODM but it's the best term i can think of.

##Documentation

Compile with `grunt compile` and run tests with `node tests`.

TODO

##Fun fact
MolnMyra is the literal Swedish translation of Cloud and Ant.
